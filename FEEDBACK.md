Here's the feedback rephrased and expanded with suggestions for improving the onboarding and developer experience:

# Feedback on XION Platform Documentation and Tooling

1. **Lack of Documentation on xion.js**:

   - I struggled to find documentation on `xion.js` in the official docs. Furthermore, there were no clear links to the team’s GitHub repositories (or at least I couldn’t find them easily). I had to search manually on GitHub to locate them and eventually found a link in the footer of the main site. It would be more user-friendly if these links were easily accessible in the docs or the developer portal.

2. **Missing Faucet Instructions in Getting Started Section**:

   - The "Getting Started" section did not include instructions on how to access testnet tokens via the faucet. I had to look through various parts of the documentation to figure this out. Adding a dedicated section with clear steps on how to use the faucet would improve the developer experience significantly.

3. **Outdated Faucet Instructions**:

   - The faucet instructions found on [this page](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/section-overview/xion-testnet-1) are outdated. The channel is now restricted, and additional steps are required to access the faucet. This should be updated in the documentation to avoid confusion.

4. **Unclear Flow in First Contract Guide**:

   - The steps in the first contract guide ([Deploy a CosmWasm Smart Contract](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/featured-guides/your-first-contract/deploy-a-cosmwasm-smart-contract)) were not clearly structured. Initially, I thought contract optimization steps weren’t included, but they were later discussed after the deployment and interaction sections. It would be better to highlight that contract optimization must be done before deployment and interaction. Adjusting the flow of the guide to address this would provide better clarity.

5. **Cargo Wasm Command Usage**:

   - The `cargo wasm` command ([link](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/featured-guides/your-first-contract/deploy-a-cosmwasm-smart-contract#confirm-contract-deployment)) doesn’t seem useful in this context because only optimized compiled code using Rust’s optimizer can be deployed and used on-chain. A more focused approach on deploying optimized code would be helpful in this section.

6. **xion.js Demo App Setup Inconsistency**:

   - The `xion.js` demo app is configured to use `pnpm`, but the README ([here](https://github.com/burnt-labs/xion.js/blob/main/apps/demo-app/README.md)) instructs to use `yarn dev`. This inconsistency should be addressed, and the documentation should explicitly mention `pnpm` as the preferred package manager. Additionally, the README should provide a step to install dependencies by running `pnpm install` in the root directory before launching the app with `pnpm dev`.

7. **Confusing Fee Granter Setup**:

   - When setting up a custom fee granter for the dapp, I didn’t realize that I had to log out and log back in for the new granter to take effect. This wasn't mentioned in the documentation, which caused confusion and unnecessary troubleshooting. Adding this step to the documentation would save developers time and effort in figuring it out.

8. **Missing Instructions for Building and Launching a Local Dev Environment**:

   - The `xion.js` README did not clearly explain how to build and launch a local development environment. I ran `pnpm install` in the root directory, followed by `pnpm run dev` in the `daps-demo` directory, which resulted in an error. It would be helpful to clarify that all commands must be run in the root directory.

9. **Deprecated -b Block Return Type**:

   - The `-b block` return type is still mentioned in many commands, but it is now deprecated, as noted in the guide for storing data to the Xion testnet chain ([link](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/featured-guides/your-first-contract/deploy-a-cosmwasm-smart-contract#store-to-osmosis-testnet-chain)). The documentation should reflect the updated options (`async` and `sync`), and the deprecated flags should be removed.

10. **Missing Flags for Transaction Execution Commands**:

    - The commands for executing transactions are missing the required `--node` and `--chain-d` flags, which are necessary for specifying the node and chain details. This omission makes it difficult for developers to run the commands correctly. Including these flags in the documentation will improve the usability and clarity of the transaction steps.

11. **Missing Query Execution Instructions**:
    - The documentation ([link](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/featured-guides/your-first-dapp/build-react-dapp-with-account-abstraxion)) and the sample dapp explain how to execute transactions using the Abstraxion library, but they do not provide instructions on how to execute queries. Developers need guidance on how to perform query operations with Abstraxion to interact with smart contracts for data retrieval, so adding this section would enhance the developer experience.

# Suggestions for Improving the Onboarding and Developer Experience:

1. **Comprehensive Onboarding for New Users**:

   - Include a clear and concise **"Onboarding"** section in the documentation with step-by-step instructions for beginners, covering everything from setting up the environment to interacting with the platform.

2. **Enhanced Search Functionality**:

   - Improve the search functionality within the documentation so users can easily find relevant guides and resources. Having a **searchable index** or **clear table of contents** will help users navigate quickly.

3. **Clearer Instructions on Prerequisites**:

   - Specify any **prerequisites** required before getting started, such as installing specific tools or dependencies. For example, outline which package manager to use (`pnpm`, `yarn`, etc.) and provide commands to install dependencies consistently.

4. **Interactive Dapp Tutorials**:

   - Instead of relying only on static documentation, consider providing **interactive tutorials** or **sample projects** to help developers get hands-on experience with the platform. This will lower the barrier for new users and give them more context.

5. **Regular Updates for Deprecations and Changes**:
   - Keep the documentation up-to-date with regular reviews, especially when there are changes in commands, APIs, or other important aspects of the platform. Deprecation warnings should be highlighted clearly, with steps to migrate to new methods.
